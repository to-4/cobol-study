Sequential Files
  - Field: This is a data item about something.
           In a customer record,
           it would be first name or last name
              or customer number or date of birth and so on.
  - Record: This is a group of fields.
            Again, in our example above, 
            a record would be information for a paticular customer.
            - Each record has two aspects(Èù¢).
              - Template: This is a general structure - That is,
                          the individual fields and what type of date each of them holds.
              - Instance of record:
                          This is a record that has data.
                          So if there is a customer account for Jane Smith, then this is an instance.

Working With Files
----------------
  - In your COBOL code, you will then have to map the data items in the record into data types.
    In other words, you will create PICS for text and numbers, 
    as we've shown earlier in this course.
    These will be put in the DATA DIVISION under the FILE SECTION.
  - Once you bring in information, you can do computaions.
    But it is also can create custom reports.
